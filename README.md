# STAT413 Final

Meant to be used alongside paper "Binary Classification Through Alternative Sigmoid Regressions," which was only given to certain individuals.

Please feel free to clone and investigate our data.

Part of the novelty to our "approach" is not using any libraries other than ISLR for a dataset, ggplot2 for visualizations, and the built-in stats library to perform Nelder-Mead optimization. Our analyses include manually implemented logistic regression, avoiding glm() entirely. Special thanks to R-bloggers for writing a blog, though not an academic resource, on manual implementation of logistic regression in R. https://www.r-bloggers.com/2013/12/logistic-regression-with-r-step-by-step-implementation-part-2/

Please read paper for details.
