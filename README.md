# STAT413 Final
## Steven Feng and Lila Frenkel
Meant to be used alongside paper "Binary Classification Through Alternative Sigmoid Regressions," which was only given to certain individuals.

Please feel free to clone and investigate our data.

Part of the novelty to our "approach" is not using any libraries other than ISLR for a dataset and the built-in stats library to perform Nelder-Mead optimization. Our analyses include manually implemented logistic regression, avoiding glm() entirely. 

Please read paper for details.
